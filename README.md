anydata
=======

Go toolkit for handling "any" type of data and source which can be turned into
a record/field structure.  This is a fairly important component to any data
warehouse and/or integration project. Although my specialty is bioinformatics
and many of my examples are based in it, these tools are general enough to be
used in many domains.

TODO List
---------
 - Flesh out data format parsers
 - More compression formats? (LZMA/7-zip, etc)
 - Other network transfer types? (RPC, aspera, etc)
